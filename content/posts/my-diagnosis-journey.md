# My Diagnosis Journey: From Mystery Symptoms to hEDS

Seven years ago, my life changed forever. What started as occasional joint pain and fatigue quickly spiraled into a bewildering array of symptoms that left me feeling like my body had betrayed me.

## The Beginning

I remember the exact moment I knew something was seriously wrong. I was reaching for a coffee mug on a high shelf when my shoulder simply... gave out. Not just pain - my shoulder actually dislocated from such a simple movement. 

At 36 years old, I was relatively healthy and active. This shouldn't have been possible.

## The Medical Mystery

What followed was a years-long journey through the healthcare system that tested every ounce of patience and resilience I had:

- **12 different doctors** across multiple specialties
- **Countless tests** that all came back "normal"
- **Dismissive attitudes** and suggestions it was "all in my head"
- **Misdiagnoses** ranging from anxiety to fibromyalgia

The most frustrating part wasn't just the lack of answers - it was feeling like I was slowly losing myself as my symptoms worsened and multiplied.

## The Turning Point

Everything changed when I found Dr. Sarah Chen, a rheumatologist who specialized in connective tissue disorders. Within the first appointment, she did something no other doctor had done: she actually *looked* at my joints.

"Can you touch your thumb to your wrist?" she asked.

When I easily demonstrated my hypermobility, her eyes lit up with recognition, not dismissal.

## Finally, Answers

After comprehensive testing and evaluation, I received my diagnoses:

### hEDS (Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome)
A genetic connective tissue disorder that affects collagen production. This explained:
- Joint hypermobility and frequent dislocations
- Skin elasticity and slow wound healing
- Chronic pain and fatigue
- Digestive issues

### POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome)
A form of dysautonomia often associated with hEDS:
- Heart rate spikes when standing
- Dizziness and fainting spells
- Temperature regulation issues
- Brain fog

### MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome)
Another common comorbidity:
- Random allergic reactions
- Food sensitivities
- Skin flushing and hives
- Gastrointestinal symptoms

## The Relief and Grief

Getting a diagnosis brought immense relief - I wasn't crazy, and I wasn't alone. But it also brought grief. These conditions are chronic and progressive. There's no cure, only management.

I had to grieve the life I thought I'd have and learn to build a new one within the constraints of chronic illness.

## What I've Learned

**Advocate for yourself.** If something feels wrong, trust your instincts. You know your body better than anyone.

**Find the right doctors.** It only takes one physician who believes you to change everything.

**Connect with others.** The chronic illness community, especially the EDS community, has been a lifeline.

**Celebrate small wins.** Progress with chronic illness isn't linear, and every good day is a victory.

## Moving Forward

Having a diagnosis doesn't solve everything, but it gives you a roadmap. I now work with a team of specialists who understand my conditions and help me manage them effectively.

Some days are harder than others, but I've learned to find joy and purpose within my new reality. Sharing my story is part of that purpose - if it helps even one person get diagnosed sooner or feel less alone, it's worth it.
