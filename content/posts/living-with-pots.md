# Living with POTS: Daily Management Tips That Actually Work

When I was first diagnosed with POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), I felt overwhelmed. The internet was full of conflicting advice, and my doctors seemed to have different opinions on everything from exercise to diet.

After three years of trial and error, I've finally found a routine that works for me. Here's what I've learned about managing POTS in daily life.

## Understanding POTS

POTS is a form of dysautonomia where your heart rate increases dramatically when you stand up. For me, this means:
- Heart rate jumping from 70 to 140+ when standing
- Dizziness and lightheadedness
- Brain fog and fatigue
- Temperature regulation issues
- Exercise intolerance

The key is understanding that POTS isn't just about heart rate - it's about blood flow and autonomic nervous system dysfunction.

## My Daily Management Routine

### Morning Routine (The Most Important Part)

**1. Hydration First**
- I drink 16-20oz of water with electrolytes before getting out of bed
- My go-to mix: 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp potassium chloride, lemon juice, and water
- This gives my body a head start on blood volume

**2. Slow Transitions**
- I sit up in bed for 5-10 minutes before standing
- When I do stand, I do it slowly and wait a moment
- I avoid bending over or sudden movements

**3. Compression Garments**
- I wear compression socks (20-30mmHg) daily
- Abdominal compression helps more than I expected
- I put them on while still lying down

### Throughout the Day

**Hydration Strategy**
- I aim for 3-4 liters of fluid daily
- Electrolyte drinks (not just water)
- Small sips throughout the day, not large amounts at once
- I track my intake with a water bottle that has time markers

**Movement and Exercise**
- **Recumbent exercise** is my friend - stationary bike, rowing machine
- I avoid upright cardio (running, elliptical)
- Short, frequent walks are better than long ones
- I listen to my body and stop before I crash

**Temperature Management**
- I carry a small fan everywhere
- Lightweight, breathable clothing
- I avoid hot showers and hot weather when possible
- Cooling towels and ice packs are lifesavers

## What Actually Works (And What Doesn't)

### ✅ **What Works for Me**

**Salt Loading**
- 8-10 grams of sodium daily (sounds crazy, but it works)
- I spread it throughout the day
- Himalayan pink salt or sea salt, not table salt

**Small, Frequent Meals**
- Large meals make my symptoms worse
- I eat 5-6 small meals daily
- High protein, moderate carbs, low sugar

**Sleep Hygiene**
- Consistent bedtime and wake time
- Cool, dark room
- No screens 1 hour before bed
- I sleep with my head elevated slightly

**Stress Management**
- Meditation and deep breathing
- Gentle yoga (avoiding inversions)
- Therapy to manage the emotional toll
- Saying no to things that drain my energy

### ❌ **What Doesn't Work for Me**

**Traditional Exercise**
- Running, jumping, high-impact activities
- Hot yoga or exercise in warm environments
- Long cardio sessions
- Exercise on an empty stomach

**Caffeine and Alcohol**
- Both make my symptoms worse
- I've switched to decaf coffee and herbal tea
- Alcohol is completely off the table

**Large Meals**
- Especially high-carb meals
- Eating too quickly
- Skipping meals

**Overheating**
- Hot showers (I take lukewarm ones)
- Hot weather without AC
- Heavy clothing
- Hot tubs and saunas

## Emergency Kit Essentials

I carry a small bag with:
- Salt tablets
- Electrolyte packets
- Compression socks
- Small fan
- Cooling towel
- Snacks (nuts, protein bars)
- Water bottle
- Emergency contact info

## Working with Healthcare Providers

**Finding the Right Doctor**
- Look for cardiologists or neurologists who specialize in dysautonomia
- The POTS community can recommend providers
- Be prepared to travel for specialists

**Advocating for Yourself**
- Keep detailed symptom logs
- Bring research and questions to appointments
- Don't be afraid to get second opinions
- Trust your instincts about what works

## The Mental Health Aspect

Living with POTS is as much a mental challenge as a physical one. I've learned:

**It's Okay to Grieve**
- Grieving the life you thought you'd have is normal
- Chronic illness changes everything
- Allow yourself to feel all the emotions

**Find Your New Normal**
- Focus on what you can do, not what you can't
- Celebrate small victories
- Build a support system of people who understand

**Practice Self-Compassion**
- You're not lazy or weak
- Rest is productive when you have POTS
- Be kind to yourself on bad days

## Progress, Not Perfection

The most important lesson I've learned is that POTS management is about progress, not perfection. Some days will be better than others, and that's okay.

**My Success Metrics**
- Fewer fainting episodes
- More energy for daily activities
- Better sleep quality
- Reduced brain fog
- Ability to work and socialize

**When to Adjust**
- If symptoms worsen, I review my routine
- I track everything in a symptom journal
- I work with my doctor to adjust medications
- I'm not afraid to try new strategies

## Final Thoughts

Living with POTS is challenging, but it's not impossible. The key is finding what works for your specific body and being patient with the process.

Remember: You're not alone. The POTS community is incredibly supportive, and there are more resources available now than ever before.

If you're newly diagnosed, start small. Pick one or two strategies from this list and build from there. Progress takes time, but it's absolutely possible.
