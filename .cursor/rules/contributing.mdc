# 🤝 Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the **Bendy_BethC Website** project!  
This repo demonstrates **design system mastery** by enforcing token-driven, responsive, and accessible development.  
Please read and follow these rules carefully when contributing.

---

## 📐 Core Principles
1. **Design System First**  
   - Always use semantic tokens (`tokens/index.css`).  
   - Never hardcode colors, spacing, font sizes, or breakpoints.  

2. **Responsive by Default**  
   - Use mobile-first classes.  
   - Apply `grid.css` utilities (`grid-mobile-4`, `grid-tablet-8`, `grid-desktop-12`).  

3. **Accessibility Always**  
   - Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios.  
   - Use `aria-label` on icon-only buttons.  
   - Focus management must use semantic focus tokens.  

4. **Consistency**  
   - Follow `.cursor/rules/` files for token, typography, responsive, and component rules.  
   - Match Figma → tokens → code exactly.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow
1. **Branching**
   - `main` → production-ready
   - `dev` → active development
   - Feature branches: `feature/<name>`

2. **Commits**
   - Use clear commit messages:
     - `feat: add Button component`
     - `fix: refactor Footer spacing`

3. **Linting & Validation**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     npm run lint
     npm run lint:css
     npm run validate:design-system
     ```
   - Fix all errors before pushing.

4. **Pull Requests**
   - Reference the related Figma node if applicable.  
   - Ensure code passes design system validation.  
   - No PR is merged with hardcoded styling.

## 🧩 Component Development
- Use **semantic utility classes**:  
  - ✅ `btn btn-primary btn-md`  
  - ✅ `text-heading-h2`  
  - ✅ `bg-surface-neutral-card`  
  - ❌ `px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 rounded-lg`
- Use **responsive tokens** for typography:  
  - `text-body-md` scales across mobile, tablet, desktop.  
- Apply **focus-visible** for accessibility.  

---

## 🚦 Rules for AI Agents (Cursor, Claude, etc.)
- Follow `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`.  
- Never copy old `/tokens` or `/styles` from legacy repo.  
- Transform hardcoded values into semantic tokens.  
- Preserve page structure, routes, API, and content.  
- Refactor navigation and footer with tokens, not custom CSS.  

---

## ✅ Contribution Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded colors, px, or hex values.  
- [ ] All typography uses semantic + responsive tokens.  
- [ ] Responsive grid utilities applied.  
- [ ] Accessibility (contrast, aria-labels, focus) enforced.  
- [ ] Code passes lint + design system validation.
